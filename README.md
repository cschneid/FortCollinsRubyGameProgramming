Presentation about Ruby Game Programming
========================================

This is a very rough presentation that I gave on Dec 18th to the Fort Collins Ruby Meetup.

`bundle install`, and then run `ruby game5.rb` if you want to see it in action.

This is a just a trivial use of Gosu & Chingu libraries. Let me know if it helps you!
